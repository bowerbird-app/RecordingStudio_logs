# Security Summary

This document outlines the security considerations for the gem_template Rails engine.

## Security Features

### CSRF Protection
- **Status**: ✅ Enabled
- CSRF authenticity tokens are enabled and enforced
- Origin check is relaxed ONLY in Codespaces environment (`ENV["CODESPACES"] == "true"`)
- This is safe because:
  - CSRF tokens remain required for all state-changing requests
  - Only the origin header check is relaxed for development convenience
  - Production environments do NOT have `CODESPACES=true` set

**Location**: `test/dummy/config/environments/development.rb:78-80`

```ruby
if ENV["CODESPACES"] == "true"
  config.action_controller.forgery_protection_origin_check = false
end
```

### Database Configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Secure
- No hardcoded passwords in repository
- Database credentials use environment variables
- Default values provided for development only

**Location**: `test/dummy/config/database.yml`

### Secrets Management
- **Status**: ✅ Secure
- Dummy app credentials live in `test/dummy/config/credentials.yml.enc`
- That file is encrypted with the shared RecordingStudio_* development master key (dev/test only; these gems have no production site)
- New gems keep this encrypted file. Do not mint a per-repo dummy master key
- Developers set `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, or write the shared key to `test/dummy/config/master.key`
- `test/dummy/config/master.key` is gitignored and is never committed

**Location**: `.gitignore` includes `test/dummy/config/master.key`

### Dependencies
- **Status**: ✅ Current
- Rails 8.1 (latest stable)
- All gems from trusted sources (rubygems.org)
- Gemspec includes `rubygems_mfa_required = true` for publishing security

### Docker Security
- **Status**: ✅ Reasonable
- Base image: `ruby:3.3-slim` (official Ruby image)
- Runs as root in development (acceptable for local dev containers)
- PostgreSQL and Redis use official images
- Volumes isolate data from host system

### Code Quality
- **Status**: ✅ Configured
- RuboCop configured for code quality
- No unsafe code patterns detected
- All code follows Rails security best practices

## Known Limitations

### Development Environment
This is a **development template** designed for:
- Learning Rails engine development
- Prototyping new engines
- Local development and testing

It is **NOT** production-ready without additional hardening:
- Add proper authentication/authorization
- Configure production database settings
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure proper backup and monitoring
- Review and harden all environment variables
- Add rate limiting
- Configure Content Security Policy properly
- Set up proper logging and auditing

### Codespaces CSRF Relaxation
The CSRF origin check relaxation in Codespaces is **intentional** for development:
- Makes development easier by avoiding CORS issues with forwarded ports
- Safe because CSRF tokens are still required
- ONLY applies when `ENV["CODESPACES"] == "true"`
- Should be reviewed if adapting for production

## Recommendations

### Before Using in Production
1. Review all environment variables
2. Set proper RAILS_ENV=production
3. Configure production database with SSL
4. Set up proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
5. Enable all security headers
6. Configure proper CORS policies
7. Add authentication/authorization
8. Set up monitoring and alerting
9. Review and test all security features
10. Perform security audit

### For Development Use
1. Keep dependencies updated: `bundle update`
2. Regularly check for security advisories: `bundle audit`
3. Use RuboCop for code quality: `bundle exec rubocop`
4. Never commit secrets or credentials
5. Use environment variables for configuration

## Security Contact

For security issues, please report via GitHub Issues or contact the maintainers directly.

## Updates

- **2025-12-04**: Initial security review completed
- **2026-10-05**: Dummy credentials use the shared RecordingStudio_* development master key; `master.key` stays gitignored
- No vulnerabilities identified in current scope
- Development environment appropriately configured
- Production hardening checklist provided

**Note**: This is a template repository. Each implementation should perform its own security review based on its specific use case and requirements.
