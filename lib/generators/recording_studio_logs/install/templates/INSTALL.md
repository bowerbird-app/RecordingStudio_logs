RecordingStudioLogs install complete.

Next steps:

1. Review config/initializers/recording_studio_logs.rb and set any required options.
2. If you use environment-specific settings, create config/recording_studio_logs.yml.
3. Install the engine migrations with `bin/rails generate recording_studio_logs:migrations`.
4. Apply the migrations with `bin/rails db:migrate`.
5. Mount routes are added at the configured mount path. Adjust auth, layout, and current actor integration to match your host app.
6. Keep strict recordable declarations enabled and add `recording_studio_recordable(...)` to every configured recordable before running `RecordingStudio.validate_recordable_declarations!`.
